# Organic Compound Visualizer

This repository contains a .NET/C# library for converting the IUPAC name of an organic compound/molecule into a two-dimensional
image of this compound/molecule. 

In another repository [OrganicCompoundVisualizerWinApps](https://github.com/thieupepijn/OrganicCompoundVisualizerWinApps) I have used 
this library to create a Console-app and a WPF-app. 

I also used this library to create an app in the Play Store, which can be found here [Organic Compound Visualizer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thieupepijn.organiccompoundvisualizer&hl=en)
